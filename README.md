## Reflection

Based on the test given instruction to have access role, i created a light-weight login page to collect ID and make sure only the wright ID access to the page and also to know the role of the current user

According to the project description, the project is to have at least two(2) user roles:

1. Engineering Manager
2. Team Lead

But i added a third role called `Member` which is the default role of a user

Below is a sample ID for each of these roles to login

Engineering Manager:
`EM_3826-dodge-user-all`

Team Lead:
`b12fa35a-9c4c-4bf9-8f32-27cf03a1f190`
